## Assignment 13
Create a program that prompts the user to input scoring totals for 5 players during 4 basketball games. The program will track which player had the highest scoring average over the 4 games and print the result to the terminal. 

Hint: Use a two-dimensional array and nested `for` loops. The outer-most `for` loop will iterate on a per game basis gathering scores for the inner-most `for` loop interating through players. Use this same model to create arrays to store total scores and to calculate averages. 

Extra Credit: There is none. This one is pretty hard!
